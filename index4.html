    <h3>Chola Samosa Chaat is a lip-smacking chaat from Indian Cuisine. The Chaat has two main components, Chole, a chickpea curry and Samosa, a savoury crisp pastry. The addition of spicy, sweet, tangy chutneys converts it into a chaat with a burst of flavours.
    </h3>
<p>
Chola or Channa is a chickpea curry and needs no introduction. I like to make the No Onion No Garlic Chole, but you can also make Chatpate Chole If you have a particular recipe that you enjoy, go ahead and cook it and combine it with Samosa.

Let us talk about the Samosa now. It is a deep-fried flaky pastry with spicy stuffing. The most common stuffing is that of potatoes and peas. The actual Punjabi samosa is big in size and might have some cashews and raisins too. The patti samosas are bite sized samosas. Moong Dal, Paneer, and Onion are the common stuffing. For today I have used the Aloo Samosa.

I love the Punjabi Samosa and my favourite combo is to sandwich the Samosa in between two soft bread slices. Samosa and Chai is another eternal combo. We cannot miss out on Samosa Chaat or Samosa Kadhi and yes Samosa Chole Chaat. The samosa, the hero ingredient has made its place in Burmese cuisine. Samusa Thuk is a lentil-based soup with Samosa.

For this week I have combined two of my favourite dishes. Chola and Samosa into a chaat under the theme Alu and Lentil.
